

1. Deploy the Application

* Make sure all translation files are correctly included in your build.
* Run the build process (e.g., npm run build for React).
* Deploy the production-ready build to your server or hosting provider (e.g., Netlify, Vercel, Firebase, etc.).
* Ensure environment-specific configuration (if any) for i18n is set up correctly in production.

2. Post-Deployment Checks

* Open the deployed application and test language switching functionality.
* Verify that:

  * All static text changes according to the selected language.
  * Date and number formatting reflect the correct locale.
  * Language switcher UI works as expected.
  * No untranslated (fallback) strings are shown.

3. Cross-Browser and Device Testing

* Test the app on multiple browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).
* Test on mobile devices to ensure responsive behavior.
* Ensure language selection persists across pages.

4. Error Handling Verification

* Ensure the application does not crash if a translation key is missing.
* Check that fallback language works properly if a translation file is incomplete.

5. Console and Network Logs

* Open browser developer tools and inspect the console for any errors.
* Verify that translation files are being fetched correctly in the "Network" tab.

6. User Feedback (Optional)

* Ask users (or testers) to use the multi-language UI and report any errors or untranslated content.

7. Final Notes

* If new languages are to be added, simply create a new translation file in src/locales/{language-code}/translation.json and update the i18n configuration accordingly.
* Make a note in your README or documentation on how to add and manage translations for future developers.
